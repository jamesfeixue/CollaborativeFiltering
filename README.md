# Personalization Project

Phase 1: 
-> Preprocessing (Current)

comment 1: 
- I have made a tidy version of the data, just need to transform it into sparse. 
- The project actually doesn't need so many users and games, so we can limit the number of users and games before transforming into sparse. 

Phase 2: 
Modeling
Evaluation

Phase 3: 
Write Up/Business Case
Clean up Github Repo.
