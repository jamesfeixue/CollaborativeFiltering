# Personalization Project

Phase 1: 
-> Preprocessing (Current)

comment 1: 
- I have made a tidy version of the data, just need to transform it into sparse. **Update** I have made a sparse set with whether the user has bought the game. 
- The project actually doesn't need so many users and games, so we can limit the number of users and games before transforming into sparse. **Update** I selected 100 random games to geneerate the sparse matrix. 

Phase 2: 
Modeling
- Begun work on Neighbhorhood based model

Evaluation
